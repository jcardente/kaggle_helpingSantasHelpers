## Kaggle Helping Santa's Helpers

This repository contains the Julia sources for my attempted solution to Kaggle's
2014 holiday contest, [Helping Santa's Helpers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers).

This repository is more for posterity than anything else. The two approaches
I tried suffered from efficiency issues that prevented me from submitting
a solution in time. That was disappointing but, as always, I learned new things
so the effort was well spent. 

Some of this code may be useful in the future which is why I'm archiving it
here.
